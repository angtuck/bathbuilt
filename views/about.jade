                | The reason our business name may be confusing about what it is we actually do! Chris started in carpentry and soon began building furniture as a hobby. Bath Built was born organically when people began to line up to buy one of his creations.

      h1.centered-text Our Process
      p
        |All of our products are hand crafted using the best woodworking techniques. This includes the use of multiple high precision planing, jointing, and cutting tools to ensure perfectly square and flat stock to work with. Doing this, accompanied with proper joinery and design methods, allows our pieces to be very stable with low chance of adverse changes over time.

      p
        |We sand, stain, and seal each piece to have a smooth finish and ensure our table tops are free of nooks and crannies that can trap food and other debris. We can however offer a more rustic finish upon request! Each piece is finished with a food safe finish that is impact and scratch resistant and will hold up to heat and liquid spills.
      p
        |We offer a variety of sizes and stain options, however feel free to e-mail us and we can quote you for a custom order to build something more customized to your needs!

        |At the end of the meet, as my teammates and I excitedly rummaged through our goodie bags, my first coach rounded us up in a small huddle before awards. Without warning, she leaned in and viscerally shouted, “You were all terrible today!”
      p
        |We look forward to hearing from you!

      h1.centered-text Payment
      p
        |A non-refundable 50% deposit is required on all pieces upon ordering. A refund in some cases may be possible, however it is at our discretion. We will send you an invoice to re-cap your order and it will have an easy “pay now” option for the deposit, however we also accept other forms of payment.
      p
        |Contact us for current wait time (usually between 4-7 weeks).
      p
        |Extra costs apply for delivery.
      p
        |Prices subject to change at any time.

      h1.centered-text Disclaimer
      p
        |All of our products are made from solid wood. We recommend our customers have a good understanding of what to expect from solid wood furniture before purchasing. Bath Built is committed to keeping each and every customer beyond happy with their furniture. We use sophisticated wood working techniques and high grade materials to ensure a high quality product. Upon pick up/delivery and transfer of the outstanding balance the sale will be considered final for the product “as is”.
